   <p> This interactive map displays the approximate location* of each observation in our final dataset at the finest taxonomic scale available (primarily at the species level but, in some cases, at the genus level). All observations include the associated site number and susceptibility level of the organism. When available, we also included an organism's morbidity status (*i.e.*, whether they tested positive for Bsal, Bd, or both) and their mortality status (*i.e.*, whether they were found alive or dead^1^). 
    
    *Please note that the data points here are jittered to protect the exact location of these organisms.
