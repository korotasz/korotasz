    <p>This interactive map displays the approximate location<sup>1</sup> of each observation in our final dataset at the finest taxonomic scale available (primarily at the species level but, in some cases, at the genus level). All observations include the associated site number and susceptibility level of the organism. When available, we also included an organism's morbidity status (<i>i.e.</i>, whether they tested positive for Bsal, Bd, or both) and their mortality status (<i>i.e.</i>, whether they were found alive or dead<sup>2</sup>). You can toggle between the "Basic Map" and the "World Imagery Map" if you would like to get a better sense of the topography in these areas.</p>
